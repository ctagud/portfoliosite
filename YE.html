        <h3 class="mb-3">Description</h3>

        <p>During my second year of University, I was involved in a team module that consisted of creating an enterprise that could offer 
          innovative solutions. The module was integrated with one of the largest Business Competitions in Europe, where many other universities would compete
          to present their solutions and bring them to life.

          <br> <br>
          
          My team comprised of people who held a variety of skills and experience as some were seasoned professionals in the industry. 


          After many meetings and brainstorming sessions, we found a gap in the sustainability and fast-fashion market, which was the amount
          of returns that people made for clothes that they deemed unsuitable. 
          Moreover, the project required us to look at this at an operational level such as: Finance, Marketing, and HR.    
          
          By this time, I had just completed my ERP Internship with Al Jazeera and I gained in-depth knowledge of functional business areas. I used this to communicate and contribute to different
          parts of the project and bring out the best ideas from team members.       
          
          I further tested my data analytics skills with stronger primary research by compiling data from questionnares that the team sent and formatted it into a dashboard
          that could fortify our research. Thus, our idea was a mobile application that could display clothing in Augmented Reality and established ourselves as <strong>Team Stylish</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>

          The enteprise idea and our performance allowed us to become one of the 16 teams to compete in the regional finals, against 7 other universities. This meant we had already beaten 195 teams
          across the region. We presented the idea to the judges and over hundreds of students. While we did not win the competition, we gained an invaluable experience that brought us together as a team.
        
        </p>

        <h3>Skills Learned</h3>

        <p>

        This experience enabled me to work collaboratively with teams from diverse backgrounds and handle them effectively. 
        While I lacked experience, I compensated through communication and problem-solving, enabling me to adapt in multiple situations. 

        The competition forced me to utilise new and unconventional ways of thinking to provide solutions and make the most appropriate decisions for the team.

        Due to these efforts, I was nominated as a contender for the Student of the Year Title in Salford Business School.
        Presenting our idea towards judges from large organisations and hundreds of people allowed me to enhance my presentation skills and 
        conquer my fear of public speaking, as I am now able to deliver presentations at a higher level.

        The presentations we had to do also required for us to squeeze information worth 20 minutes worth of content to 4 minutes.
        Because of this, I learned to convey information and data concisely.

        The competition improved my business acumen as I developed the project with people who were specialised at certain fields. I was able to listen to their insights
        and improve the feasibility of our idea by setting realistic parameters such as 
        looking at the market trends and feasibility of idea with balance sheets and financial forecasts.

        <br><br>
        I also learned to technical skills that I learned at my own time towards the project. This meant that I have developed a pragmatic approach to my learning styles
        and I can easily find ways to contribute teams with skills I learned which can refine projects and improve speed of delivery.

        <h3>What Could Have Been Done Differently?</h3>


        <p class="mt-3">
          Looking at our loss in the competition at an objective point of view, there were many factors that contributed into it.

          As I later gained experience at SAP, I realised we could have enhanced the overall presentation of our business by
          creating a Landing Page or Video for judges to increase our points, potentially allowing us to progress even further.

          Upon looking at the other teams, I saw that they properly developed their prototypes to working products. Our application was
          merely at the prototype stage, we could have developed it further to include features close to the vision we had.

          The presentation style and delivery could have been improved by utilisng better body-language from all team members or humour
          to engage audiences instead of simply pitching our product.
          <br><br>
          The team suffered from unforseen circumstances due to one of our members facing
          health difficulties. It became evident that we became disorganised as a team and we struggled to meet
          deadlines or complete tasks. Ontop of this, a certain team member simply did not contribute. This resulted in me taking a huge part of the workload to compensate for her 
          absence.
          To avoid such situations, a project management tool should have been introduced to ensure that the work is equally
          split and ensure deadlines or milestones are met. This could have included Gannt Charts, Notifications, and fixed team meetings to bring us
          closer to our deadlines. We later used Monday.com and improved our overall workflow but it could have been optimised more
          effectively to maximise our output.
          
          Moreover, I could have also been more assertive in my leadership style or gathered
          collectively as a team to correct this individuals actions.
