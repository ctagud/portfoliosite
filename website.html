  The portfolio website aims to to act as a digital placeholder to showcase my projects and skills that I have developed over time. 
  Many of these skills cannot be projected in CV format. Therefore, a website is used to present them. Through building one, it can enhance an individuals 
  professional profile as more of these are required in technical fields. By utilising HTML/CSS and Javascript, I was able to customise my website without 
  any restrictions from Website Builders.
</p>
  
  <p>
    While building this website, I felt that I was able to practice many skills I gained from my placement being in a Creative Team.
    However, this project was unique as other websites I did were specifically for customers and I had to theme most of the designs
    based on their design rules and creative assets which restricted my creative vision.
  </p>

  <h3>Considerations</h3>


  <p>
    I was able to incorporate elements of myself and research best practices for portfolio websites and inspiration from other existing sites.
    I decided early on that blue and white would be the main colours since these are mostly found in brands in the Technology industry, representing success.
     My challenge was that I pondered over different design elements to work with a simple colour scheme as this directly influences the user experience and theme.  
     Due to this, I changed the design many times. With some drafts being related to architecture or designs that relied on bigger fonts. After more research and gaining inspiration, 
     I found a font and background that could compliment the entire website.

    </p>

    <div class="row p-5">
      <div class="col-md-6 mb-3">
        <img src="assets/img1.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      </div>

      <div class="col-md-6">
        <img src="assets/img2.png" class="img-fluid" alt="">
      </div>
    </div>

    <br>

  <p>
    The Home Page should provide recruiters with the feeling of familiarity with the technical field since the background is a dashboard of the International Business Communication Standards. 
    I also considered how users could be retained and ensure my projects or links are clicked by creating buttons that link to other pages of the website.

    As I included the content for <strong>The Journey</strong> page, I was reminded of all the experiences I went through, skills I learned
    and relationships I have built over time, which have me to the person I am today. I included this section because I realised that recruiters look at candidates as headcounts as they are not able to
    see the story behind the CV. The section aims to humanise my profile to establish a stronger connection with recruiters. Moreover, I did not find other websites that had this page, making it unique to me.
    <br> <br>

  <br>

  <h3>Challenges Faced and Skills Learned</h3>
  <p>

  I faced many challenges creating the e-portfolio as I used HTML, CSS and Javascript. Despite given the option to use Website Builders such as Wix, I wanted to use Mark-up and programming languages because they can provide more control 
  and flexibility without restriction. Moreover, I also wanted to prove my technical ability to employers as I previously used these tools before. However, obstacles were present while I changed the design as this itself is time-consuming. I faced further difficulties
  to make it more functional to users and responsive in mobile because it is a manual process using those technologies.

  However, I was able to adapt as I gained more experience in Web Development throughout the project. I gained inspiration from open-source code posted by other users and fixed many issues
  and learned new skills that I could not find out before.
    <br> <br>
  As I settled with a blue and white design to represent my portfolio, I had to compromise many other elements that I am familar with. Therefore, my solution was to maximise the website using a minimalist design. 
  I explored new design rules that could make this type of website better such as: Subtle drop shadows and horizontal lines, increased white spacing, interactive elements such as fade on scroll or a progress bar.

  I learned to diversify the way I can present relevant content and prioritise on user engagement to keep visitors from exploring the website page. 
  For example, the <strong>Portfolio Page</strong>, I strategically planned to create and place content to improve likelihood of employability.
  The Recruiters will be able to see my experiences in a clear and concise manner as it does not contain text-heavy information. 
  While the journey page  <strong>Journey page</strong> does contain more text, I was able to format it to a story to encourage users to read and scroll further down.
  Through this, I acknowledged the importance of personal branding as it can make an individual more reliable.

        <h3>What Could Have Been Done Differently?</h3>
        
        <p>To further improve the website, more interactive features could be implemented. This includes things such as different hover effects with a cursor or 
          a momentum scroll which would enhance the user experience. Since the website aims to have a minimalistic style, white spacing should be increased as it can enhance 
          visual hierarchy and provide a "breathing room" for the users eyes, as they are proven to be aesthetically more pleasing since they prevent content from being compressed. However, this was not executed due to problems in maintaining 
          the effectiveness of responsive mode on mobile view. Further discovery of effective responsive design can be done to be implemented in the future.

          Pictures of higher quality with similar colour schemes and backgrounds are able to compliment these and enhance the user interface without making it plain. 
          I found that some pictures do not load immediately and users who open the site for the first time may experience worse. If I gained more knowledge of Javascript, I would
          minimise the loading indicators, which would serve well for higher quality images.

          <br><br>
          
          Lastly, without the constraint of time, I would gather more feedback from both designers and users to identify areas of improvement. Usability testing would allow me
          to find bugs that I am unaware of or suggest new features that can be based on user needs.
