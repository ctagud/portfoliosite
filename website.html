  <p>
    While building this website, I felt that I was able to practice many skills I gained from my placement being in a Creative Team.
    However, this project was quite different as other websites I did were specifically for customers and I had to theme most of the designs
    based on their design rules and creative assets which restricted my creative vision.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this website, I was able to incorporate elements of myself and research best practices for portfolio websites and inspiration from other existing sites.
    My challenge was that I pondered over different design elements to work with a simple colour scheme as this directly influences the user experience and theme of the website.
    Due to this, I changed the design many times.

    I incorporated blue and white as main colours of the website since these were main colours found in the Technology industry, representing success.
    However, after delving into more research and inspiration from existing sites, I found a font and background that could compliment the entire website.

  <h3>Challenges Faced</h3>
  <p>

  I faced many challenges creating the website as I am using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Despite given the option to use Website Builders such as Wix, I wanted to use these Mark-up and programming languages because they can provide more control 
  and flexibility. Moreover, I also wanted to prove my technical ability to employers as I previously used these tools before. Obstacles were present while I changed the design as this itself is time-consuming. I faced further difficulties
  to make the website more functional to users and responsive in mobile because it is a manual process using those technologies.

  However, I was able to adapt to these obstacles as I gained more experience in Web Development throughout the project. I gained inspiration from open-source code posted by other users and fixed many issues
  and learned new skills that I could not find out before.
    <br>
  As I settled with a blue and white design to represent my portfolio, I had to compromise many other elements that I am familar with. Therefore, my solution was to maximise the website using a minimalist design. 
  I explored new design rules that could make this type of website better such as: Subtle drop shadows and horizontal lines, increased white spacing, interactive elements on scroll and high quality pictures.

    The Home Page should provide recruiters with the feeling of familiarity with the technical field since the background hero is a dashboard of the International Business Communication Standards. 
    I also considered how users could be retained and ensure my projects or links are clicked by creating buttons that link to other pages of the website.

    As I included the content for <strong>The Journey</strong> page, I was reminded of all the experiences I went through, skills I learned
    and relationships I have built over time, which have me to the person I am today. As I am near at the end of this chapter, I am hopeful of greater things to come.
    
    I included this section because I realised that recruiters look at candidates as headcounts as they are not able to
    see the story behind the CV. The section aims to humanise my profile to establish a stronger connection with recruiters.
    <br>
    For the <strong>Portfolio Page</strong>, I had to strategically plan to create and place content to improve likelihood of employability.
    The Recruiters will be able to see all my experiences that I elaborate on which were not mentioned in my CV and
